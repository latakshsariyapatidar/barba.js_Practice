# Page Transition Website

This is a simple multi-page website built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It demonstrates smooth transitions between pages using GSAP for animations and Barba.js for handling the page switching.

The project contains three pages: Home, About, and Contact. Each page includes a navigation bar, a header title, and a page number at the bottom. All pages share the same layout and design for a consistent look.

The visual transitions between pages are handled by a white overlay that expands and collapses vertically, creating a smooth animation effect. The header text on each page also slides in smoothly after the transition is complete.

The CSS defines a dark theme with white text and a simple layout using the Prompt font from Google Fonts. The JavaScript file controls the animation timeline using GSAP and manages the page transitions using Barba.js.

This project is useful for learning how to create basic page transitions in a website without using any heavy frameworks. It is ideal for beginners exploring frontend animation techniques.
